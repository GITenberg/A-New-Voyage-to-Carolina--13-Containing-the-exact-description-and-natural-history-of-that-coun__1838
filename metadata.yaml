description: John Lawson's amazingly detailed yet lively book is easily one of the
  most valuable of the early histories of the Carolinas, and it is certainly one of
  the best travel accounts of the early eighteenth-century colonies. An inclusive
  account of the manners and customs of the Indian tribes of that day, it is also
  a minute report of the soil, climate, trees, plants, animals, and fish in the Carolinas.Lawson's
  observation is keen and thorough; his style direct and vivid. He misses nothing
  and recounts all -- from the storms at sea to his impressions of New York in 1700,
  the trip down the coast to.
